#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  - Software Engineering is writing instructions called code for computers. It involves buliding games, apps and websites that make our lives easier, while solving real-world problems through technology. It is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  1. The development of programming languages such as Fortran in in the 1957 and C in 1972
  2. Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
  3. The surfacing of structured programming in the 1970s
  4. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  1. Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
  2. Creating detailed designs of te software architecture and user interface
  3. Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications
  4. Performing various tests to ensure that the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
  5. Releasing the software to the customers or users
  6. Conducting maintenance by providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  - The Waterfall methodology is linear and sequential. There is extensive upfront planning and it has fixed stages. It is best for structured, predictable projects such as medical device development or a factory automation system. Agile methodology on the other hand is iterative and flexible. There is continuous planning and adaptation, with short cycles and regular updates. It can be used when developing e-commerce platforms and Mobile App development.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  - A Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
  - A Quality Assurance Engineer ensures the quality of the software by designing and executing test plans
  - A Project Manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
 - IDEs provide tools for writing, debugging and testing code and they include platforms like Visual Studio Code, Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA. VCS are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordiating team work such as Git and Subversion.
 - These tools enhance productivity, collaboration and code quality by providing developers with features such as code editors, debugging tools and automated testing capabilities.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  - Changing requirements during the development cycle can lead to project delays. This can be overcome through effective communication and using agile methodology.
  - Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality. This can be overcome through prioritization of tasks and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  - Unit testing involves testing individual components or modules of software.
  - Integration tests interactions between different components or subsystems.
  - System testing tests the entire software as a whole.
  - Acceptance testing tests the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user/client needs.
  - Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix any problems early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  - Prompt engineering is the process of designing and improving instructions given to AI in order to get the best possible responses. It is important because if we want AI to do exactly what we need, we must know how to talk to it. It helps us get accurate, relevant and high-quality responses from AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  - To write a good prompt, you must be clear, specfic and provide a context. For example:
  "How did COVID affect technology?", is a vague prompt. A more improved prompt would be "How did the COVID-19 Pandemic accelerate the improvement of technology in healthcare, remote       work and e-commerce?". This prompt is more focused as it narrows down key areas affected by the pandemic, guides a response as it asks about improvement and it encourages detailed       examples.
